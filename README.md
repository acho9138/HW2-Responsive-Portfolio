# HW2-Responsive-Portfolio

## Description

A responsive website were components on the page adjust according to the screen size. 
It contains three pages which include:

    - About me
        Contains a profile photo and "about me" content

    - Porfolio
        Contains sample projects where the links are not functional

    - Contact me
        Contains a form where the user can enter their details and send a message

It was a fun challenge for a novice coder with no web development background undergoing an intense coding bootcamp. It pushed boundaries and forced hours of Googling, resulting in a semi-decent functional website.

Everything was possible because there was always an answer on the Internet.
