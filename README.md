# Responsive Portfolio

## Description

A responsive website were components on the page adjust according to the screen size. 
It contains three pages which include:

- About me
- Porfolio: includes real projects coded by Anna
- Contact me

It was a fun challenge for a novice coder with no web development background undergoing an intense coding bootcamp. It pushed boundaries and forced hours of Googling, resulting in a semi-decent functional website.

Everything was possible because there was always an answer on the internet.
